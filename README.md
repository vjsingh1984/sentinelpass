# SentinelPass

Local-first password manager with a Rust core, Tauri desktop UI, and browser extension.

## At a Glance

| Area | What SentinelPass does |
| --- | --- |
| Secret model | Zero-knowledge, local vault; no cloud dependency |
| Crypto | Argon2id key derivation + AES-256-GCM encryption |
| Multi-device sync | Optional E2E encrypted sync via relay (Ed25519 auth, LWW conflict resolution) |
| App surfaces | CLI (`sentinelpass`), daemon, desktop UI, browser extension, relay server |
| Platforms | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| License | Apache License 2.0 |

## System Map

| Component | Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core library | `sentinelpass-core/` | Crypto, vault, DB, IPC contracts |
| CLI | `sentinelpass-cli/` | Vault operations from terminal |
| Daemon | `sentinelpass-daemon/` | Background unlock/lock state + IPC |
| Native host | `sentinelpass-host/` | Browser native messaging bridge |
| Desktop app | `sentinelpass-ui/` | Tauri UI and user unlock workflow |
| Browser extension | `browser-extension/` | Autofill + save prompts |
| Relay server | `sentinelpass-relay/` | E2E encrypted sync relay (zero-knowledge) |

## Runtime Flow

```text
Browser Extension -> sentinelpass-host -> sentinelpass-daemon -> sentinelpass-core (vault)
                         ^                      |
                         |                      └── SyncEngine (optional)
                    sentinelpass-ui                    |
                    (unlock + state)             sentinelpass-relay
                                                 (encrypted blobs only)
```

## Install

| Platform | Method |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | Download the DMG from [Releases](../../releases), open it, drag SentinelPass to Applications |
| Windows | Download the MSI installer from [Releases](../../releases) and run it |
| Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) | `sudo dpkg -i sentinelpass-*.deb` |
| Linux (Fedora/RHEL) | `sudo dnf install sentinelpass-*.rpm` |
| Build from source | `npm install && npm run web:build && cargo build --release` |

> **Tip:** GitHub release links use 302 redirects — use `curl -L -O <url>` when downloading from the command line.

## First Launch

1. Open **SentinelPass** from your Applications folder / Start Menu / launcher.
2. Create a new vault and set a master password.
3. The app automatically starts the background daemon and registers the native messaging host for Chrome, Chromium, and Firefox.

## Browser Extension

| Browser | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| Chrome | `chrome://extensions/` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → select `browser-extension/chrome/` |
| Firefox | `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → **Load Temporary Add-on** → select `browser-extension/firefox/manifest.json` |

After installing the extension, **restart the browser** so it picks up the native messaging host manifest written by the app.

## Multi-Device Sync

Sync your vault across devices using the E2E encrypted relay. The relay never sees plaintext.

1. **Start the relay** (self-hosted): `cargo run --bin sentinelpass-relay`
2. **Initialize sync** on the first device: `sentinelpass sync init --relay-url http://localhost:8743`
3. **Pair additional devices**: run `sentinelpass sync pair-start` on device A, then `sentinelpass sync pair-join --relay-url <URL> --code <CODE>` on device B.

See [`docs/SYNC.md`](docs/SYNC.md) for the full protocol reference, CLI commands, and relay configuration.

## Verify

1. Visit any login page — an autofill icon should appear next to password fields.
2. If not, check the Troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| "Specified native messaging host not found" | Restart the browser after launching SentinelPass at least once |
| Autofill icon doesn't appear | Ensure the daemon is running (check SentinelPass UI status) |
| "Vault is locked" | Unlock the vault in the SentinelPass UI first |
| Extension installed but not working | Open DevTools → Console → filter for `[SentinelPass]` logs |

You can also re-register the native host manually:

```bash
# macOS / Linux — from installed app bundle
./installation/install.sh --from-app-bundle

# macOS / Linux — from source build
./installation/install.sh
```

## Developer Loop

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Rust format check | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| Rust lint (deny warnings) | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| Rust tests | `cargo test --workspace` |
| TypeScript typecheck | `npm run web:typecheck` |
| TypeScript tests + coverage | `npm run test:ts` |
| Relay server | `cargo run --bin sentinelpass-relay` |
| Rust coverage (LLVM) | `bash scripts/coverage-rust.sh` |

## Release Artifacts

| Trigger | Workflow | Output |

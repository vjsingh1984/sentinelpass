## Scope

Security reports are especially valuable for:
- cryptography and key handling (`sentinelpass-core/src/crypto/`)
- vault lock/unlock and daemon IPC (`sentinelpass-core/src/daemon/`)
- browser extension/native host boundaries (`browser-extension/`, `sentinelpass-host/`)
- install/update trust chain and manifest registration
